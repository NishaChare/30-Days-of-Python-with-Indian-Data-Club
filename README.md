,# 30-Days-of-Python-with-Indian-Data-Club
Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my coding corner where I'm diving into the #30DaysOfPython challenge hosted by Indian Data Club 🚀
This repository is my way of tracking progress, sharing learnings, and documenting everything I build — one Python-powered day at a time!

🎯 What’s the Goal?
To build a solid foundation in Python by committing to write code every single day for 30 days — with the amazing support of the Indian Data Club community. The idea is simple: show up daily, code consistently, learn deeply 💪

📚 What You’ll Find Here
Each folder or file in this repo maps to a specific day in the challenge.
Here’s a running log of what I’ve worked on so far:
